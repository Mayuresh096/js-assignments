In Javascript, there are five basic, or primitive, types of data.
The five most basic types of data are strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, and null.

Strings : 
    Strings are collections of alphanumeric characters and symbols.
    This is how we’re gonna store letters and words.

Numbers :
    Numbers are just what they sound like.
    They’re numbers, including both integers and decimals.

Booleans :
    Booleans can only have two values True and false. 
    They represent all data that only has two states, like a light switch On or off.

Undefined :
    The undefined data type means that the variable has been created, but has never been given a value.

Null :
    Null is similar to undefined, except it has to be set intentionally.
    It also means empty or nothing.
